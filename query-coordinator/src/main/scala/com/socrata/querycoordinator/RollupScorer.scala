/**
 * A very trivial rule based optimizer that assigns scores to rollups to try to determine which is the best one to
 * query given multiple options.  In a world of great complexity this approach is more or less doomed to failure
 * due to not having enough information, however it is simple to implement the simple cases and can go a long way and
 * we don't need to be at the level of sophisitication of an advanced cost based optimizer.  If we ever do we are
 * probably barking up the wrong tree.
 *
 * All decisions are made off the structure of the rollup with no insight into the actual size of the rollup
 * or the actual query execution plan.
 *
 * A score is assigned by adding up the following laughingly simplistic rules:
 *
 * - Number of GROUP BY clauses
 *  - 0
 *   - If all functions are aggregates, 0 since this should be a one line rollup!
 *   - Else 100000 * the number of columns in the selection to greatly penalize this non-rollup rollup
 *  - >0 then 100 * the number of GROUP BYs, with the assumption each one increases the size of the rollup
 * - For each "top level" AND clause in the WHERE clause, reduce the score by 10 points with the assumption each one
 *   makes the rollup smaller.
 * - For each value in the selection, give a minor penalty of 1
 *
